# Expanding-Cards

## About
This mini project has individual expanding cards when clicked on.  These cards can be used for client testimonials, job project slides and for any web application that may have cards they would like to expaned or close.

## Purpose
I created this mini project to help build my skill set in the fundamentals of web development. This project gave me a better understanding of 
HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
